# Craftitizer Global Repository

**See:** https://github.com/treyzania/Craftitizer

This is where I'm storing package definitions for Craftitizer.  If you would
like to have your package featured, fork this repo, add your package, then make
a pull request.  Unlike what one might expect from a Git repository, different
versions of each package actually *are* in different files, so that means that
when you release a new version of your package you should put it in a different
file.
